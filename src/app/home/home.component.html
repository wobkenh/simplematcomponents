    <h2>SimpleMatTable</h2>
    <p>SimpleMatTable is an abstraction of MatTable from the @angular/material dependency. It allows you to
      quickly
      and in a typesafe way define tables. This is perfect if you want to display data in a table and do not need
      full
      control over the table HTML.
      <br>
      <br>
      Instead of copy/pasting the HTML for each column, you can describe the columns in a declarative way via
      Typescript code. A lot of different options like align, buttons, icons and even custom css allow you to
      further
      customize your table.</p>
    <p>In this demo, you will see some of the key features of simplemattable and how to use them. For a more
